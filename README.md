# raytraycing-in-a-weekend

<p>This is me literally following the guide from the web-textbook <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#thevec3class/colorutilityfunctions"> Ray tracing in one weekend </a>.</p>
  <p> It was super easy and fun! I will soon add the resulting picture.</p>

  <p> Unfortunately this ray tracer is not even multithreading and is working on the CPU so it takes a shitload of time to render and not even in a window but to a ppm file. Hopefully the next two books will show how to render on screen and in realtime))</p>
